            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:62902:5"/>This Succe≈øs of <hi>Columbus</hi> ≈øounded by the Trump of Fame awakened the ≈øloathful and incredulous <hi>World,</hi> who before would believe nothing po≈ø≈øible but what their eyes could behold, or their outward ≈øen≈øes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom: The <hi>World</hi> thus awakened, and having wiped their eyes with the <hi>Gold</hi> of <hi>COLUMBINA,</hi> ≈øaw more clearly their former Errors: Now the <hi>Golden-Age</hi> returns again <hi>Gold</hi> is exchanged for trifles, ≈øuch as Knives, Hatchets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were valued at ≈øix times their weight in Gold; and Pearls, and Diamonds bear but an equal value with gla≈øs: But this la≈øted not long; for immediately ≈øuch multitudes of Ships lanched out with expectations of gain, that they ≈øoon exhau≈øted the di≈øcovered <hi>Mines,</hi> and reduced it almo≈øt to an equal value with that of <hi>Europe.</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62902:7"/>length drawing nearer to it we e≈øpied Hou≈øes, or rather Hills as they ≈øeemed to us by their Gra≈øs-Coverings; before this Town we ca≈øt Anchor, and made an Ob≈øervation, and found our ≈øelves in the Latitude of fifty Degrees thirteen Minutes, South; and the Longitude Two hundred ≈øeventy five De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees thirty Minutes. We had not rid at Anchor above three hours before we could e≈øpy a <hi>Canoo</hi> coming over to us from the Town; the rea≈øon of which we could not well apprehend; at length draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to us, we e≈øpied in it an <hi>European,</hi> as his Complexion and Habit did ≈øhow; he had in his hand a ≈øhattered torn Jack-flag, in which we might di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ≈øomething of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Arms: Being come to the Ship-≈øide, he ≈øaluted us with the≈øe words, <hi>Dios vos guarda hermanos;</hi> which in the <hi>Portugue≈øe</hi> language ≈øignifies, <hi>God ≈øave you my Brethren:</hi> I then returned his Salutation in his own language, ≈øaying, <hi>Sea bien veni do Hermano.</hi> Welcome Brother; and invited him into the Ship: which Invitation he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepted, and came into the Ship; our Seamen would have taken the men in the <hi>Canoo</hi> into the Ship, but he would not ≈øuffer them, telling us they were Slaves, and ought not to be ≈øo much Countenanced: We took this <hi>Portugue≈øe</hi> into the great Cabin, and gave him the be≈øt Entertainment our Ship could afford; after three or four hours ≈øtay in our Ship, he took his leave, and gave us an Invitation to his Hou≈øe, which he told us was in that Town we ≈øaw; and promi≈øed likewi≈øe to ≈øend <hi>Canoo's</hi> for the whole Ship's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which he accordingly performed in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning following.</p>

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62902:8"/>
The Natives that Rowed in the <hi>Canoo's</hi> were all hairy, having no other Cloathing than what Nature had furni≈øhed them withall; and the lea≈øt of them by computation above Eleven foot high; by the≈øe Gygan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick men, we were ≈øafely conducted to the Town, which con≈øi≈øted of about a thou≈øand Hou≈øes, built of Timber, and covered over the top with Boughs of Trees wreathed together; and over them were placed very curiou≈øly Gr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At length we were Conducted to this <hi>Portugue≈øe</hi> Hou≈øe, who it ≈øeems was Governour of this Town, and <hi>Cacique,</hi> or King of that part of the Country: His Hou≈øe was built after the ≈øame manner with the re≈øt, bur much bigger.</p>
               <p>At the Entrance to his Hou≈øe he received us with a great deal of Expre≈ø≈øions of Joy, and conducted us into a very fair Room, where we were plentifully entertained with roa≈øted Veni≈øon, and Wine in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</p>
               <p>Having pretty well ≈øatisfied our ≈øelves, he di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øed with us concerning our Adventures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to us the manner of his Adventures, ≈øince his coming from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> after this manner.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I <hi>Va≈øques de Pagna</hi> ≈øet ≈øail from <hi>Lisbon</hi> in the year One thou≈øand ≈øix hundred forty-≈øix, upon the ≈øame account that you did from <hi>Am≈øterdam,</hi> and by accident made this I≈øland: being curious in the Di≈øcovery, I fir≈øt Coa≈øted about the two I≈ølands, and then put into the <hi>Fretum,</hi> that parts the two I≈ølands; and ob≈øerving this River that runs up into the Country, I ventured into it; re≈øolving to venture ≈øo far till I could ≈øee either Hou≈øes or Inhabitants; but by the neglect of my Mate, not being careful enough in ≈øounding the Channel, my Ship unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ≈øtruck upon a Sand, and ≈øplit in a very ≈øhort time, giving us little ≈øpace to ≈øhift for our lives; in this ≈øtreight every Man endeavouring to ≈øave him≈øelf, my ≈øelf with two more got ≈øafe to the Shore; but of the re≈øt of our Company I never could hear of ≈øince, and therefore conclude they were all drowned. We ≈øought about for ≈øhelter from the Cold and Rain, it being about the time of the Winter-Sol≈øtice, at which time it is rather Colder than it is with you in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62902:9"/>At length we found a large hollow Tree, into which we entred, and ≈ølept for that night.</p>
               <p>The next Morning as ≈øoon as we could ≈øee, we went to the Water-≈øide to ≈øee whether any thing was driven a ≈øhore, or floated near to Land; when we came there we e≈øpied ≈øeveral pieces of our Ship floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about; and walking along by the ≈øhore we found a Barrel of Bisket, and near to that our Jack-Flag, both which we took up and went away very joyfully towards our Arbour, where we ≈øecured them, and gave thanks to God for his great mercy in making ≈øuch Provi≈øion for us: Upon this Bisket we lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Months, and ≈øpent our time in Prayers, and walking the Grounds near to the Tree, retreating upon the lea≈øt noi≈øe to our Harbour: In the ≈øecond Month one of my Companions fell ≈øick and died, and at three Months end my other Companion.</p>
               <p>Now was I left in a mi≈øerable Condition, my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany dead, and my Victuals almo≈øt ≈øpent; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I comforted my ≈øelf with the≈øe thoughts, that the ≈øame God that hitherto had ≈øo plentifully provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for me, would ≈øtill take care of me; I now re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to travel up farther into the Country, and if there were any Inhabitants (for as yet I had ≈øeen none) to commit my ≈øelf to their mercy; being thus re≈øolved, I thought to leave ≈øome Memorial behind me, that if it ≈øhould happen that any <hi>European</hi> ≈øhould light upon this place, they might know what Adventure I had made; I therefore took the Jack-Flag, and with a black-lead Pencil writ the≈øe Words as plain as I could, <hi>Va≈øques de Pagna of Lisbon was here;</hi> and then ≈øecured it in a convenient place in the Tree,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62902:9"/>where it might be ≈øecure from the injuries of weather. Then I took the remainder of the Bisket, and de≈øired God to pro≈øper my Journey, and travelled into the Country.</p>
               <p>In two days travel I di≈øcovered hairy people, ≈øuch as you ≈øee; at fir≈øt I was ≈øomething fearful of them, but my fear was ≈øoon taken away, for I found them to be more fearful of me, admiring at my Clothes and Complexion; and were ready to adore me. Walking a little further, I could e≈øpy, as it were, a grove of Hills which were their Hou≈øes, who≈øe plea≈øant Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure was very delightful; being come near to the Town, I was ≈øurrounded with hundreds of the≈øe Hairy-people, admiring me, and making offers to adore me, ≈øuppo≈øing I was a god; but I did what I could to hinder them. At length it came to the King's ear, who came him≈øelf with ≈øeveral Prie≈øts to vi≈øit me, and made ≈øigns to me to let them know what I was; fir≈øt lifting up their eyes to Heaven, and then pointing to me, and then to the Heavens again; but I let them under≈øtand by the like ≈øigns, that I did not come immediately from Heaven, but hoped to go thither; and this I did by fir≈øt pointing to the Earth from whence I came, and to the Heavens whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I hoped to go. With which they were well ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and conducted me to the <hi>Caciques</hi> Hou≈øe (for ≈øo they call their Kings): The <hi>Cacique</hi> telling his Prie≈øt (as I have been ≈øince informed by his Daughter my Wife) that I was of Coele≈øtial Extract, and fit for no Company but the Gods and Kings. At this Palace I fared very well; and having very ≈ømall hopes of returning to my Country, or ≈øeeing any of <hi>Europe,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62902:10"/>I thought it my be≈øt way to a≈ø≈øure my ≈øelf of a Being among≈øt them, and this I did by ingratiating my ≈øelf with the <hi>Cacique</hi>'s Daughter, whom I found very ready to receive any kindne≈øs from me; her Father likewi≈øe ca≈øting a plea≈øant a≈øpect on both, did give me encouragement to make ≈øome offers of Amours, which was kindly received, and we in a ≈øhort time married according to the Cu≈øtom of the Countrey; of which with their other Rites and Cu≈øtoms, I ≈øhall give you a full account hereafter. Being married, he gave me Two hundred Slaves, and bid me chu≈øe out a place in the I≈øland to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and build a Town that might be called by my Name.</p>
               <p>Having taken my leave, I with my Wife and Slaves with ≈øtore of all ≈øorts of Provi≈øion, came towards this place, which I the rather made choice of, becau≈øe it was the place I formerly had taken po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of; likewi≈øe hoping, that being near to this River, ≈øome <hi>European</hi> might at ≈øome time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happen to ≈øail into it, as I had done.</p>

               <p>HAving given us this relation of his Adventure, he carried us and ≈øhewed us the hollow Tree they fir≈øt lodged in, which ≈øtands at the entrance to his Hou≈øe, painted with a ≈øort of red Paint, like to our <hi>Oker,</hi> but much brighter colour; with which Commodity that part of the Countrey doth much abound: Then he carried us, and ≈øhewed us the places where he formerly had buried his Companions, over who≈øe Bodies he had cau≈øed to be erected <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids,</hi> covered with Mo≈øs, and curiou≈øly checker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Boughs of Trees woven together cro≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62902:11"/>younger, one was Nine foot, and the other Seven foot in heighth. But that which was mo≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, was, that his Second Son and Elde≈øt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were ≈ømooth as we are, and yet retained the Nature of the Countrey as to height.</p>
               <p>Being pretty well ≈øatisfied with our entertainment and diver≈øions, we de≈øired his leave to return to our ≈øhip, but he would not grant it, telling us that we ≈øhould lye there that night; and then conducted us into another large Room, wherein was Hammocks provided for us to lye upon; here he treated us again with two or three Movyles of Wine, (which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyle contained about a Gallon); having drank up our Wine, he bid us good-night, and left us to our repo≈øe.</p>
               <p>Next morning as ≈øoon as Sun was up, he came to us, and asked us how we ≈ølept, and called for a Movyle of Wine for our Morning's-draught, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed likewi≈øe ≈øome Veni≈øon to be brought to us, with which having broke our fa≈øt, he carried us to ≈øee his Town, and the Church which he had built.

They believe that they that live well here, and do no man any injury, and obey the Laws of the <hi>Cacique,</hi> they ≈øhall enjoy much happine≈øs after death, in plea≈øant fields, behind the Hills. At three times of the year they offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to their <hi>Dieu</hi> (as they call him) who appears in a

               <p>Their manner of Marriage is in this manner: The Parents of both parties being fir≈øt agreed, the Father of the Maid brings out his Daughter to the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and they immediately upon the fir≈øt ≈øight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to their Patents their liking or refu≈øal of each other; if they declare their liking, the Father of the Damo≈øel in the pre≈øence of one of their <hi>Fritazeers,</hi> or Prie≈øts, gives his Daughter to the Young-man, and with her gives her Dowry, which is one or more Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, according to his ability and their former agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; after this the <hi>Fritazeer</hi> offers a Sacrifice to the <hi>Dieu,</hi> and the Marriage is celebrated.

               <p n="2">

                  <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Precepts to be ob≈øerved by ≈øuch as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the≈øe Adeventures.</head>
               <p>FIr≈øt, Let them be provided with a good ≈øtrong Ship, ≈øtore of Provi≈øion, Weapons defen≈øive and offen≈øive, with a ≈øufficient quantity of Ammunition, and convenient In≈øtruments for pro≈øpection and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Let the Seamen be healthy, ≈øtout, re≈øolute Blades, ≈øuch as are re≈øolved again≈øt all dangers that may happen.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Let them be very curious in their Ob≈øervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and calculate the Longitude and Latitude of all places they touch at.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Let them keep their Journal-book exactly; truly and faithfully recording all the pa≈ø≈øages of the Voyage, as the ≈øeveral changings of the Wind; the rumbs and di≈øtance of ≈øailing upon tho≈øe rumbs; the true ≈øounding of the Channels in tho≈øe Harbours they enter, and what rocks or ≈øands they meet with, giving ≈øome nece≈ø≈øary rules and cautions for ≈øhunning tho≈øe dangers.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Let them carefully ob≈øerve the variation of the Compa≈øs, with the Currents, and trade-Winds.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb facs="tcp:62902:15"/>
VI. Let them u≈øe their utmo≈øt endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand the Religion, Cu≈øtoms, Manners, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, with the Inclinations of the Inhabitants, and commit it to writing, that they may give a true acccount of them when they return home.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Let them be curious in ob≈øerving the Clouds; by the clearne≈øs of them whereof, they may know when they draw near to land: for by their pa≈ø≈øing over the land, wanting a ≈øupply of Vapours, the Clouds become more white and clear, as <hi>Columbus</hi> ob≈øerved and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. "When in the day-time they ob≈øerve the Clouds gathering together in heaps near the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, looking blew, and a ≈øection appear on that part of the Hemi≈øphere, or by night di≈øcover fire, they may be certain they are approaching to land.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. When they come near to the land, let them fir≈øt coa≈øt along by it, and curiou≈øly ob≈øerve the Creeks and Harbours, their manner of bearing, with their forms or figures.</p>
               <p n="10">X. When they have coa≈øted ≈øo long that they are ≈øufficiently ≈øatisfied of the figure and ≈øituation of the place, and have found out a convenient River, either broad enough to ≈øecure them from any attempt the Natives may make upon them from ≈øhore; or el≈øe who≈øe banks are di≈øtant from Woods or other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øheado's.</p>
               <p n="11">XL. When they find an opportunity to venture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhore, let them go well armed, that they may awe the Natives; who when they ≈øee their ≈øtore, or bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed arrows do not pierce them, as they do their own Country-men, will be ready to offer divine ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:62902:16"/>to them; but let them be very prudent in this ca≈øe; neither ab≈øolutely hindering it, yet mode≈øtly denying ≈øuch adoration, by pointing to the heavens, letting them know there they ought to pay their devotion; for by ab≈øolutely hindring their Adoration, they thinking you to be men, will make other attempts upon you, as the <hi>Indians</hi> did upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at their fir≈øt coming thither, by holding them ≈øo long under water till they were confirmed they were mortal.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Let them be very careful when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to traffick, and live quietly among≈øt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that they ≈øhew good examples to them by their good lives and conver≈øations; let them be ju≈øt in all their dealings, punctual to their promi≈øe, and civil to the Natives in general.</p>
